Longest Subarray with Majority Greater than K

Given an array arr[] and an integer k, the task is to find the length of longest subarray in which the count of elements greater than k is more than the count of elements less than or equal to k.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1], k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The subarray [2, 3, 4] or [3, 4, 1] satisfy the given condition, and there is no subarray of length 4 or 5 which will hold the given condition, so the answer is 3.

Input: arr[] = [6, 5, 3, 4], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: In the subarray [6, 5, 3, 4], there are 4 elements > 2 and 0 elements <= 2, so it is the longest subarray.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
0 ≤ k ≤ 106

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(n)
